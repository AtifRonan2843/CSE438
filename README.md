# Bangla Digit Recognition Across Different Variations of CNN Models

This project focuses on using varying approaches to CNN Models to
recognise Handwritten Bengali digits, which poses significant
challenges for traditional recognition algorithms. Moreover, we
explore the integration of ensemble techniques with CNN
architectures to harness the collective intelligence of multiple models,
thereby enhancing the classification accuracy, recall and precision to
variations.
